# JIRA Board Issue Type Mapping Summary

## 📋 Your JIRA Board Configuration

Your JIRA board has the following issue types:
- **Improvement**
- **New Feature**
- **Bug Report**
- **Technical Support**

## 🎯 1-to-1 Mapping Configuration

### Current Mappings (Configured)

| GitHub Issue Template | GitHub Label | JIRA Issue Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🐛 Report a Platform Issue / Bug | `Bug Report` | `Bug Report` | ✅ Active |
| 💡 Suggest an Enhancement | `Improvement` | `Improvement` | ✅ Active |
| ❓ Request Support | `Technical Support` | `Technical Support` | ✅ Active |
| 🚀 Request a New Feature | `Feature Request` | `New Feature` | ✅ Active |

### Default Fallback

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### `label-mapping.json`
```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "Bug Report": "Bug Report",
    "Improvement": "Improvement",
    "Technical Support": "Technical Support",
    "Feature Request": "New Feature"
  },
  "defaultIssueType": "Technical Support"
}
```

### GitHub Issue Templates

## ⚡ Automatic Field Mapping

### Priority Detection (Bug Reports)
- **"High - Production system is down"** → `Highest` priority
- **"Medium - A non-critical feature"** → `Medium` priority
- **"Low - Minor issue or cosmetic"** → `Low` priority
- **Urgent keywords in title/body** → `High` priority
- **Default** → `Medium` priority

### Component Assignment (Bug Reports)
- **REELS** → Component: REELS
- **ALPHA** → Component: ALPHA
- **TRINITY** → Component: TRINITY
- **AI HUB** → Component: AI HUB

### Feature Request Priority (New Template)
- **"High - Critical for business operations"** → `High` priority
- **"Medium - Would significantly improve workflows"** → `Medium` priority
- **"Low - Nice to have enhancement"** → `Low` priority

## 🚀 Testing Results
